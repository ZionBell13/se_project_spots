**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Building a responsive site that adapts individual elemrents to varying screen sizes,and mirroring figma layout at specific screen width points via media queries.

**Figma**

Using the linked figma design below, we aim to match the brief's specifications to each screen width. This implements not only the use of responsive design principles, but also a brief introduction to the use of media queries.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
